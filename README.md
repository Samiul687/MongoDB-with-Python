# MongoDB-with-Python

I began this project as I wanted to understand how databases work and was informed that MongoDB is a good place to start. This programme allows a teacher to add, edit and retrieve details of a student. In addition to this, I have also upgraded the programme since to use a Linear Regression model to predict the future grades of students using current stored data as training data (although this still has bugs and so hasn't been uploaded yet). This works as MongoDB allows users to export collections as CSV files which can then be manipulated by pandas and used by sklearn.
